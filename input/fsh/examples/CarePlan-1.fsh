		<strong>
			<em>FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS</em>
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Here below are listed personalized follow-up recommendations, based on the treatments you received. These advices are based on international experience with people who received similar treatments as you.</p>
	<p>They are meant to prevent and/or diagnose at an early stage possible future complications.</p>
	<p>It is possible that over time these recommendations will be updated according to new clinical situations and/or new data in the scientific literature. We will make all possible efforts in order to update about any new update.</p>
	<p>We encourage you to report to your doctor any persistent symptom you might have, in order to allow an early identification of its cause.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<strong>General recommendations</strong>
	</p>
	<p>A healthy lifestyle helps to maintain physical and mental wellbeing, as well as preventing possible diseases such as cardiovascular complications, tumors, and psychological problems.</p>
	<p>We therefore recommend you to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Maintain a normal body weight and engage in regular physical activity.</li>
		<li>Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and reduce fat, sugar, and salt intake.</li>
		<li>Don't smoke and avoid excessive alcohol intake.</li>
		<li>Maintain proper dental hygiene.</li>
		<li>Avoid excessive sun exposure and remember to use high-protection sunscreen.</li>
		<li>Check your blood pressure periodically.</li>
		<li>Report to your health care provider any experience of chronic pain, excessive fatigue and/or deterioration of performance in your daily activities (study, work and/or exercise).</li>
		<li>Adhere to all cancer screening programs that will be offered by the health system.</li>
	</ul>
