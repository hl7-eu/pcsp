### Scope

> Specify **HL7 FHIR logical models** and **profiles** to be used within
> the European project **PanCareSurPass**. This project studies the
> scale-up and implementation of the digital Survivorship Passport to
> improve people-centred care for childhood cancer survivors.

### The PancareSurPass Project

#### Overview 

**<span class="underline">PanCareSurPass</span>** is a EU funded
Research and Innovation action aiming to study the scale-up and
implementation of the digital Survivorship Passport to improve
people-centred care for childhood cancer survivors.

PanCareSurPass will conduct a robust assessment of the implementation of
the Survivorship Passport by first conducting a pre-implementation study
in six countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Spain)
representing three infrastructural scenarios in Europe. The Survivorship
Passport is an innovative, digital tool, developed in previous EU-funded
projects, that can be used to overcome well-known knowledge gaps to
improve people-centred long-term survivorship care.

#### Objectives

The overall aim of PanCareSurPass is to **leverage the digital
transformation of healthcare to improve people-centred survivorship care
by scaling up and implementing an interoperable SurPass v2.0 across
Europe.**

##### Preparation for Implementation

1.  **design and conduct a multi-country pre-implementation study** to
    assess the barriers and facilitators for scaling up use of the
    SurPass v2.0

2.  **develop a practical Implementation Strategy** informed by the
    findings of the pre-implementation activities and **IT technical
    specifications** for SurPass v2.0 ensuring interoperability and
    cybersecurity.

3.  **develop, test and launch SurPass v2.0** using the IT
    specifications developed use in the multi-country implementation
    study.

##### Implementation and evaluation

4.  **conduct a multi-country implementation study of SurPass v2.0** for
    people-centred care with >5-year CCS and to **assess
    implementation** in terms of people-centred care (e.g. activation,
    empowerment, satisfaction, increase in knowledge), feasibility and
    cost effectiveness.

5.  **conduct a parallel observational qualitative study using SurPass
    v2.0** for delivering people-centred survivorship care to <5-year
    CCS and >5-year CCS (but with limited treatment data available).

##### European Future Implementation & Achieving Impact

6.  **develop a Prediction Model** using data from the
    pre-implementation activities and multi-country implementation study
    to enable healthcare decision-makers to assess the suitability and
    costs of SurPass v2.0.

7.  **host an Implementation Toolkit** for further European
    implementation of the SurPass for people-centred care in various
    healthcare settings across Europe.

8.  **disseminate and communicate the importance of people-centred
    survivorship care and results of PanCareSurPass** to key
    stakeholders to promote future implementation of SurPass v2.0 to
    improve people-centred survivorship care in Europe.
